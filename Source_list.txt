Question: How have the levels and constitution of air pollution changed in the U.S. over the last few decades at both a national and local level?
Okay, I am a little confused on what I’m supposed to write here so please be forgiving.
Please consult the captions for each sheet. Most of the explanation for the data is there.
A brief summary of my data and source:
My data comes from the AirData section of the EPA’s web site (https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html). Specifically, I used the Annual Summary Data: AQI by county for the years 1980 through 2017. I merged and cleaned these files before importing into Tabelau. The data is a summary of the yearly Air Quality Index data for U.S. as calculated by the EPA. In general, AQI is a measure of a pollutant’s presence compared to its defined acceptable level. Where multiple pollutants are measured, the total AQI is the value of the pollutant with the highest individual AQI. Total AQI is then used to qualify measured days as Good Days (AQI: 0-50), Moderate Days (AQI: 50-100), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups Days (AQI: 100-150), Unhealthy Days (AQI: 150-200), Very Unhealthy Days (AQI: 200-250) and Hazardous Days (AQI: 250-300). Additionally, the determining pollutant, the one with the highest individual AQI, is also recorded. More information about AQI can be found here https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi and here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index#United_States
I filtered the data by dividing all measures, e.g. good days, moderate days, pollutants, etc. by the number of recorded days for that monitoring site in order to have comparable data. The average was then taken over all monitoring sites per year under consideration (and current filters) to produce the values used in the chart.
A quick description of what each sheet is and what it does:
The Dashboard consists of two charts: the National Air Quality from 1980 to 2017 sheet and the Dominant Pollutant Each Day by Percent of Total Days sheet, both of which are filterable by state and county concurrently.
The National Air Quality from 1980 to 2017 sheet provides an overview of the data from 1980-2017 at a national level while allowing the user to drill down to a state by state level if they so desire.
The Dominant Pollutant Each Day by Percent of Total Days sheet shows the percentage of the recorded days that the stated pollutant was used to determine total AQI. This value is averaged over all monitoring stations under consideration (e.g. filtered).
The Six Most Populous States and Six Least Populous States sheets are self explanatory and were intended to act as references in the dashboard but dashboard space was lacking.
Context for Air Quality Monitoring Data Sheet I highly recommend. Click through the filter on year to see the spread of the monitoring stations and the increase in the number of days of data during the period.
Addressing the rubric:
Does the dashboard contain two or more charts? 
Yes, it contains two charts as mentioned above. I would have liked to have included more but it led to the data being squeezed and unreadable. Tableau, or least my public version, is more limited than I would prefer, and I often felt as if I were designing for the tool and not the data. 
Are the chart types (e.g. bar, line, scatterplot) appropriately chosen with respect to the kind of data shown (e.g. categorical v. quantitative, continuous v. discrete)? 
I believe they are. Line graphs were used for the quantitative continuous v. quantitative discrete data that I used in most of my sheets. I tried both bar charts and area graphs, but they made it harder to distinguish trends and line charts were clearest. 
Are the axes and legends appropriately labeled? 
I tried to ensure that all labels and legends are appropriately labeled. They are all customized to the labels that I chose. I hope that they are clear and easily understood. 
Are effective color palettes chosen? 
The color palettes that I chose were either industry standards (AQI) or highly differentiated. I used the Tableau’s automatic selection for the pollutants, but that’s because they seemed the best choice. I tried others and they didn’t look as good. For the Context for Air Quality Monitoring Data Sheet I chose the green-gold spectrum as I thought the darker colors gave a good solidity to the counties with the most data points and the higher luminance gold values tended to contrast more with their surroundings and draw attention as you scroll through the year filter to the lower data point counties that tended to be new. 
Is the data shown in the context of an overview? 
I believe I have. I did not zoom or manipulate the data on the dashboard. I left that for the user to do through filter selection.
